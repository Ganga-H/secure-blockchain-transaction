## 🌟 Overview
This project is a comprehensive **secure transaction system** built on **Ethereum blockchain technology**.  
It provides a robust platform for executing and tracking financial transactions with enhanced security features, user authentication, and real-time monitoring capabilities.

The system consists of three main components:
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure token implementation with transaction tracking  
- **Backend API**: RESTful services for authentication and blockchain interactions  
- **Frontend Application**: Modern UI for user interactions and transaction management  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔒 **Secure Transactions**: Blockchain-based token transfers with cryptographic security  
- 👤 **User Authentication**: Complete authentication flow with JWT and blockchain verification  
- 💰 **Daily Limits**: Configurable transaction limits to prevent unauthorized large transfers  
- 📊 **Transaction History**: Comprehensive tracking and visualization of all user transactions  
- 👁️ **Real-time Monitoring**: Live updates on transaction status and blockchain events  
- 🖥️ **Responsive Design**: Modern dark-themed UI that works across devices  
- 🛡️ **Enhanced Security**: Multiple layers of protection including input validation and rate limiting

## 📝 Usage

### Smart Contract Development

bash
npx hardhat compile       # Compile contracts
npx hardhat test          # Run tests
npx hardhat node          # Start a local Hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>   # Deploy contracts
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <contract_address>   # Verify contracts


### Backend Development

bash
- cd backend
- npm run dev


Access the API at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Frontend Development

## 🌐 Deployment

### Smart Contracts

* **Local**: Deploy to Hardhat local network
* **Test**: Deploy to Sepolia testnet
* **Production**: Deploy to Ethereum mainnet

### Backend & Frontend

* Deploy to AWS, Heroku, Vercel, or other hosting platforms

* Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

---

## 🔒 Security

* Never commit your `.env` files or private keys
* Keep sensitive data in environment variables
* Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities
* Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
* Use secure HTTP headers and CORS policies
* Follow blockchain security best practices
